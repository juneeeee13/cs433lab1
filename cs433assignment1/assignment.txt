QUESTION 1: Run the code 5 times? Is the sequence of the outputs the same?
    Refer to beforemodification.png
    The sequence of the outputs is not the same
---------------------------
QUESTION 2: Why the sequence of the outputs different?
    The outputs are different because of process scheduling. One may run before the other.

---------------------------
QUESTION 3: If you want to insert a code(print command) to the above program so that both child and parents would execute.
where would you insert it?
    Inserting a print statement that both the child and parent would execute can work anywhere after the fork command.
    Because the fork command has been run, the code in the lines after the command have been duplicated.
    Therefore, the print statement we added would be in both the original program and the duplicated fork program.
---------------------------
QUESTION 4: Run the modified program.
    Refer to aftermodification.png
    We can see that the print statement is outputed twice, once for the original program and a second time for the forked program.
